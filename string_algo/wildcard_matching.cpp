/* Question:
String matching where one string contains wildcard characters
Given two strings where first string may contain wild card characters and second 
string is a normal string. Write a function that returns true if the two strings 
match. The following are allowed wild card characters in first string.

* --> Matches with 0 or more instances of any character or set of characters.
? --> Matches with any one character.
For example, “g*ks” matches with “geeks” match. And string “ge?ks*” matches with 
“geeksforgeeks” (note ‘*’ at the end of first string). But “g*k” doesn’t match with 
“gee” as character ‘k’ is not present in second string.
