/* Singleton Pattern
the singleton pattern is a design pattern used to implement the mathematical concept of a singleton, by
restricting the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed
to coordinate actions across the system. The concept is sometimes generalized to systems that operate
more efficiently when only one object exists, or that restrict the instantiation to a certain number of
objects.
