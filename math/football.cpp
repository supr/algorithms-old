Question:
given a number, calculate how many unique, order-independent ways there are to achieve a score of that number in American Football.

Let's see how few characters can be used in each of your favorite languages! The usual rules apply. Input and output in a way 
that is natural to your language.

Recall that the ways to score in Football are:
safety (2 points), 
field goal (3 points), 
touchdown (6 points),
touchdown + extra point (7 points), 
and touchdown + 2-point conversion (8 points).

For example, given 9 as input, the program should return 4, since you could score:

1 touchdown + extra point and 1 safety
1 touchdown and 1 field goal
3 field goals
3 safeties and 1 field goal

Note that order does not matter.
