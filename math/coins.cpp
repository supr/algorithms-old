Question:
Given some dollar value in cents (e.g. 200 = 2 dollars, 1000 = 10 dollars), find all the combinations of coins that make up 
the dollar value. There are only penny, nickel, dime, and quarter. (quarter = 25 cents, dime = 10 cents, nickel = 5 cents, 
penny = 1 cent)

For example, if 100 was given, the answer should be...
4 quarter(s) 0 dime(s) 0 nickel(s) 0 pennies
3 quarter(s) 1 dime(s) 0 nickel(s) 15 pennies
etc.
