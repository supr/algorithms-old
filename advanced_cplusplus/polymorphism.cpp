// Runtime Polymorphism
// greek: "poly" â€“ many, "morph" - form
// the same method can be called on different objects
// When you call a function with a common name, the runtime decides which implementation to call depending 
// on the current program context.
// The main thing to note about the below program is, derived class (Rectangle, Triangle) function is called 
// using a base class pointer (Polygon). The idea is, virtual functions are called according to the type of 
// object pointed or referred, not according to the type of pointer or reference. In other words, virtual 
// functions are resolved late, at runtime.
//
// How does compiler do this magic of late resolution?
// Compiler maintains two things to this magic:
// vtable: A table of function pointers. It is maintained per class.
// vptr: A pointer to vtable. It is maintained per object.
//
// Compiler adds additional code at two places to maintain and use vptr.
// 1) Code in every constructor. This code sets vptr of the object being created. This code sets vptr to 
// point to vtable of the class.
// 2) Code with polymorphic function call (e.g. bp->show() in above code). Wherever a polymorphic call is 
// made, compiler inserts code to first look for vptr using base class pointer or reference (In the above 
// example, since pointed or referred object is of derived type, vptr of derived class is accessed). Once 
// vptr is fetched, vtable of derived class can be accessed. Using vtable, address of derived derived class 
// function show() is accessed and called.
// If the Base Class Destruktor is not virtual:
// Since Base's destructor (Polygon) is not virtual and b is a Base* pointing to a Derived object (Triangle), 
// delete b has undefined behaviour. In most implementations, the call to the destructor will be resolved 
// like any non-virtual code, meaning that the destructor of the base class will be called but not the one 
// of the derived class, resulting in resources leak.
// If a class has any virtual function, it should have a virtual destructor, and that classes not designed 
// to be base classes or not designed to be used polymorphically should not declare virtual destructors.

// Compile-Time Polymorphism
// Instead of inheriting behavior from a base class and overriding it, the Child, or implementing type, is passed 
// in as an instantiation argument. This creates a new type, which is the dynamic behavior we want. Using the 
// following code, we achieve the same output as before.
